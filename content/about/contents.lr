### Hi there 👋

My name is Olena Yefymenko. I’m an aspiring Python developer. My first IT experience was obtained in the cloud area during my internship. I learned and implemented many new technologies and tools, including serverless AWS services and IoT core devices. It was not easy, but interesting.

However, learning was always an integral part of my life. I've spent a significant part of my career in data analysis and research. Also, I had familiarity with scientific activity during my studding at university. So, my job expertise contributed the habit to study constantly and search insights.

Like most of us, I store notes in my computer or in the Cloud. However, considering that *learning to public* provides a deeper understanding of the issues we study, I have come up with the idea that sharing my learning process is a good approach to improving knowledge. It's also important that I have the chance to help someone.

Reflecting on various learning areas, I've outlined some objectives for my blog:

👁️ Analyze basic software design patterns.
🐍 Share insights and best practices in Python development.
🌐 Dive deep into Django framework, publish some step of my own project.
🛠 Highlight related tools, libraries, and frameworks that supercharge Python and Django development.     
🌥️Consider topics of cloud technologies (perhaps, I will prepare for the next AWS certification exam).

*To find out what I'm currently working on, you can take a look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/OlenaYefymenko).*

Obviously, I am not expert in these spheres, but I strive to self-improvement and have motivation to work a lot. We'll see what happens😉.
